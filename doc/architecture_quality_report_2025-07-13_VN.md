| Issue Density | 0.00 | ✅ No issues found |
| Code Duplicates | 0 | ✅ No duplication detected |
| Redundant Code | 0% | ✅ Clean code |
| Structural Debt | 0 | ✅ No technical debt |

---

### 🔗 2. Coupling and Cohesion
| Metric | Value | Comment |
|--------|--------|----------|
| ACD (Average Component Dependency) | 5.08 | ⚠️ Could be improved to reduce tight coupling |
| CCD (Cumulative Component Dependency) | 716 | 📈 High for a growing system |
| NCCD (Normalized CCD) | 0.82 | ✅ Below 1 – acceptable |
| Maintainability Level | 92.54 | ✅ Excellent maintainability |
| Propagation Cost | 3.60 | ✅ Low – good design separation |

---

### ⚙️ 3. Complexity
