## 📊 A/I Chart

### Abstractness vs Instability Analysis

#### Overview

This chart is based on principles from *Robert C. Martin* and visualizes the tradeoff between **Abstractness (A)** and **Instability (I)** of each module. It helps assess the internal architecture quality of a system and guides refactoring efforts.

- **Abstractness (A)**: Ratio of abstract classes and interfaces in a module.
- **Instability (I)**: How likely a module is to change (i.e., how many modules depend on it vs how many it depends on).
- **Distance (D)**: Deviation from the "Main Sequence" (ideal balance between A and I), computed as `D = |A + I - 1|`.

#### Zones

The chart is divided into three main zones:

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ **Safe Zone** | Modules near the "Main Sequence" (A + I ≈ 1). These have a good balance between abstraction and stability. |
| ❌ **Zone of Pain** | Modules with low A and low I. They are stable but too concrete, making changes risky and expensive. |
| ⚠ **Useless Abstraction Zone** | Modules with high A and high I. Highly abstract but unused, which adds unnecessary complexity. |

#### Example Modules

| Module         | Abstractness (A) | Instability (I) | Distance (D) | Zone                    |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| `app module`   | 0.18             | 0.47             | 0.35          | Near **Zone of Pain**    |
| `service layer`| 1.00             | 0.33             | 0.33          | Slightly **overabstracted** |

#### Recommendations

- Consider refactoring `app module` to extract interfaces or reduce fan-in to reduce architectural debt.
- `service layer` is acceptable, assuming it provides shared contracts, but should be monitored for overengineering.

---

## 📝 Recommendations

- ✅ **Keep current structure**, no major refactors needed.
- 🔍 Monitor ACD and CCD in core components.
- 🔐 Integrate into CI/CD to enforce architectural compliance.
- 📊 Use this report as a baseline for future regressions.

## 🗓️ Conclusion

The system shows **excellent code quality and architectural integrity**:

- No cycles
- No duplicates
- Very low complexity
- Maintainability above 90%

> "Clean code, clean architecture, future-proof."
