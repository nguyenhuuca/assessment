# PR-FAQ: [Product/Feature Name]

Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions
Filename: artifacts/pr_faq_[feature].md
Owner: Architect (/architect)
Handoff to: Architect (/architect) for feasibility, then PRD creation
Related Skills: writing-pr-faqs, brainstorming, requirements-analysis

This document comes BEFORE the PRD in the planning process.
Uses Amazon's "Working Backwards" methodology.

Best Practices:
- Write as if the product is already launched (future tense → past tense)
- Keep total length to 5-6 pages maximum
- Focus on customer benefits, not features or technical details
- Problem paragraph must demonstrate deep customer understanding
- Most PR-FAQs don't get approved — this is a feature, not a bug
- Iterate multiple times before presenting for approval

Reading process: Everyone reads the document in silence at the start of review meetings
(typically 20 minutes for 6 pages). Do not send as pre-read.
