# Brainstorming

## Principles

1. **Quantity over quality**: Generate many ideas first
2. **No judgment**: Defer criticism until later
3. **Build on ideas**: Combine and extend
4. **Wild ideas welcome**: Encourage creativity

## Techniques

### Mind Mapping
Start with central concept, branch out associations.

```
                    ┌── Mobile App
                    │
         ┌── UI ────┼── Web App
         │          │
         │          └── CLI
         │
Product ─┼── Features ── [list features]
         │
         │          ┌── PostgreSQL
         └── Data ──┤
                    └── Redis
```

### SCAMPER
- **S**ubstitute: What can be replaced?
- **C**ombine: What can be merged?
- **A**dapt: What can be borrowed from elsewhere?
- **M**odify: What can be changed?
- **P**ut to other uses: Different applications?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed?
- **R**everse: What if we flip it?

### How Might We (HMW)
Reframe problems as opportunities.

```
Problem: Users abandon signup
HMW: How might we make signup feel rewarding?
HMW: How might we reduce signup friction?
HMW: How might we show value before signup?
```

### Crazy 8s
1. Fold paper into 8 sections
2. 8 ideas in 8 minutes
3. One idea per section
4. Sketch or write

## Idea Evaluation

After brainstorming, evaluate ideas:

| Idea | Impact | Effort | Risk | Priority |
|------|--------|--------|------|----------|
| Idea 1 | High | Low | Low | Do First |
| Idea 2 | High | High | Med | Plan |
| Idea 3 | Low | Low | Low | Maybe |

## Diverge → Converge

1. **Diverge**: Generate many ideas (no filter)
2. **Organize**: Group similar ideas
3. **Converge**: Select best ideas to pursue
