# Reaching Consensus

## Consensus vs. Voting

**Voting**: Majority wins, minority loses
**Consensus**: Everyone can support the decision

## Consensus Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Fully support |
| 2 | Support with minor concerns |
| 3 | Can live with it |
| 4 | Have serious concerns |
| 5 | Cannot support |

Goal: Everyone at level 3 or better.

## Techniques

### Fist of Five
Quick check on support:
- **5 fingers**: Fully support
- **4 fingers**: Support
- **3 fingers**: OK with it
- **2 fingers**: Concerns
- **1 finger**: Strong concerns
- **Fist**: Block

### Gradients of Agreement

2. Supportive Yes
3. Willing Yes

5. Stand Aside
6. Block

### Proposal-Based
